standard examples -- try File -> New File -> R Markdown -> Shiny -> Shiny
Document. Much more documentation is
[available on Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html).

### Embed Entire Application

It's also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown
document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny
application located in another directory: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  "discountCurveShiny", options=list(width="100%", height=550)
)
```
