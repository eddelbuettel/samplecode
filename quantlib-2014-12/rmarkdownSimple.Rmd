This R Markdown document is made interactive using Shiny, following a
standard examples -- try File -> New File -> R Markdown -> Shiny -> Shiny
Document. Much more documentation is
[available on Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html).

### Standard Inputs and Outputs

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are
automatically updated whenever inputs change.  This demonstrates how a
standard R plot can be made interactive by wrapping it in the Shiny
`renderPlot` function. The `selectInput` and `sliderInput` functions create
the input widgets used to drive the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```
